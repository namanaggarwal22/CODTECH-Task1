### Project: LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES
The primary objective of this project is to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, the percentage of the lower status population, and the pupil-teacher ratio in different areas. By building a linear regression model, we aim to understand the relationship between these features and the price of houses, which can help in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

### Key Activities
- **Data Collection and Loading:** Access the Boston Housing dataset from external sources (e.g., statsmodels library).Understand the dataset structure and relevant features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Select relevant features and target variables for the analysis,Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Model Building:** Implement a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.Train the model on the training dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Make predictions using the test dataset.Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- **Interpretation and Insights:** Analyze the model's coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on housing prices.Discuss potential applications and limitations of the model.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

### Key Insights
- **Population Distributions**: Histograms to show how populations have been distributed over time.
- **Inter-year Relationships**: Scatter plots to reveal relationships between population data from different years.
- **Correlation Patterns**: Heatmaps to display the correlation between populations over the years, highlighting significant trends and patterns.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of global population trends and insights, useful for further studies or policy-making related to demographic changes.
